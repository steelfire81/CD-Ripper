STEELFIRE'S CD RIPPER

The goal of this project is to create a program capable of ripping audio from a music CD and storing it in popular formats (.MP3 and .FLAC are the two I have in mind, but I may add more once those are done).  The end program I have in mind will have a full GUI that allows a user to appropriately tag any files exported.

As of right now, the project is in super early stages.  At the time of writing this, the program is capable of exporting .WAV files from a CD, but it cannot store in any other formats.  It's more of a library at this point as well, as the program cannot rip a CD by itself since the main is a test main.
